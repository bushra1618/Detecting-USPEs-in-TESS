# Detecting-USPEs-in-TESS
Graphs generated from the code will illustrate:

Periodograms: Showing the detection of sub-day orbital periods. (uses Savitsky-Golay Filter)
Phase Folded Light Curves: Highlighting any unexpected variations or patterns 
Statistical Anomalies: Presenting data that deviates from classical expectations, supporting the hypothesis of quantum mechanical influences.

Main ojective:To study the periodicity and characteristics of ultra-short period exoplanets using TESS data.
